# Advent
--- Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation ---

Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering presents to other planets! To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

The Elves quickly load you into a spacecraft and prepare to launch.

At the first Go / No Go poll, every Elf is Go until the Fuel Counter-Upper. They haven't determined the amount of fuel required yet.

Fuel required to launch a given module is based on its mass. Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.

For example:

    For a mass of 12, divide by 3 and round down to get 4, then subtract 2 to get 2.
    For a mass of 14, dividing by 3 and rounding down still yields 4, so the fuel required is also 2.
    For a mass of 1969, the fuel required is 654.
    For a mass of 100756, the fuel required is 33583.

The Fuel Counter-Upper needs to know the total fuel requirement. To find it, individually calculate the fuel needed for the mass of each module (your puzzle input), then add together all the fuel values.

What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm ---

On the way to your gravity assist around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a "1202 program alarm". On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: "Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--" The ship computer bursts into flames.

You notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. "That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!"

An Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.

Opcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.

For example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.

Opcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.

Once you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.

For example, suppose you have the following program:

1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50

For the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:

1,9,10,3,
2,3,11,0,
99,
30,40,50

The first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:

1,9,10,70,
2,3,11,0,
99,
30,40,50

Step forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:

3500,9,10,70,
2,3,11,0,
99,
30,40,50

Stepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.

Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:

    1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).
    2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).
    2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).
    1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.

Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?
------------------------------------------------

--- Day 3: Crossed Wires ---

The gravity assist was successful, and you're well on your way to the Venus refuelling station. During the rush back on Earth, the fuel management system wasn't completely installed, so that's next on the priority list.

Opening the front panel reveals a jumble of wires. Specifically, two wires are connected to a central port and extend outward on a grid. You trace the path each wire takes as it leaves the central port, one wire per line of text (your puzzle input).

The wires twist and turn, but the two wires occasionally cross paths. To fix the circuit, you need to find the intersection point closest to the central port. Because the wires are on a grid, use the Manhattan distance for this measurement. While the wires do technically cross right at the central port where they both start, this point does not count, nor does a wire count as crossing with itself.

For example, if the first wire's path is R8,U5,L5,D3, then starting from the central port (o), it goes right 8, up 5, left 5, and finally down 3:

...........
...........
...........
....+----+.
....|....|.
....|....|.
....|....|.
.........|.
.o-------+.
...........

Then, if the second wire's path is U7,R6,D4,L4, it goes up 7, right 6, down 4, and left 4:

...........
.+-----+...
.|.....|...
.|..+--X-+.
.|..|..|.|.
.|.-X--+.|.
.|..|....|.
.|.......|.
.o-------+.
...........

These wires cross at two locations (marked X), but the lower-left one is closer to the central port: its distance is 3 + 3 = 6.

Here are a few more examples:

    R75,D30,R83,U83,L12,D49,R71,U7,L72
    U62,R66,U55,R34,D71,R55,D58,R83 = distance 159
    R98,U47,R26,D63,R33,U87,L62,D20,R33,U53,R51
    U98,R91,D20,R16,D67,R40,U7,R15,U6,R7 = distance 135

What is the Manhattan distance from the central port to the closest intersection?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Day 4: Secure Container ---

You arrive at the Venus fuel depot only to discover it's protected by a password. The Elves had written the password on a sticky note, but someone threw it out.

However, they do remember a few key facts about the password:

    It is a six-digit number.
    The value is within the range given in your puzzle input.
    Two adjacent digits are the same (like 22 in 122345).
    Going from left to right, the digits never decrease; they only ever increase or stay the same (like 111123 or 135679).

Other than the range rule, the following are true:

    111111 meets these criteria (double 11, never decreases).
    223450 does not meet these criteria (decreasing pair of digits 50).
    123789 does not meet these criteria (no double).

How many different passwords within the range given in your puzzle input meet these criteria?

Your puzzle input is 178416-676461.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids ---

You're starting to sweat as the ship makes its way toward Mercury. The Elves suggest that you get the air conditioner working by upgrading your ship computer to support the Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal.

The Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal (TEST) starts by running a diagnostic program (your puzzle input). The TEST diagnostic program will run on your existing Intcode computer after a few modifications:

First, you'll need to add two new instructions:

    Opcode 3 takes a single integer as input and saves it to the position given by its only parameter. For example, the instruction 3,50 would take an input value and store it at address 50.
    Opcode 4 outputs the value of its only parameter. For example, the instruction 4,50 would output the value at address 50.

Programs that use these instructions will come with documentation that explains what should be connected to the input and output. The program 3,0,4,0,99 outputs whatever it gets as input, then halts.

Second, you'll need to add support for parameter modes:

Each parameter of an instruction is handled based on its parameter mode. Right now, your ship computer already understands parameter mode 0, position mode, which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a position - if the parameter is 50, its value is the value stored at address 50 in memory. Until now, all parameters have been in position mode.

Now, your ship computer will also need to handle parameters in mode 1, immediate mode. In immediate mode, a parameter is interpreted as a value - if the parameter is 50, its value is simply 50.

Parameter modes are stored in the same value as the instruction's opcode. The opcode is a two-digit number based only on the ones and tens digit of the value, that is, the opcode is the rightmost two digits of the first value in an instruction. Parameter modes are single digits, one per parameter, read right-to-left from the opcode: the first parameter's mode is in the hundreds digit, the second parameter's mode is in the thousands digit, the third parameter's mode is in the ten-thousands digit, and so on. Any missing modes are 0.

For example, consider the program 1002,4,3,4,33.

The first instruction, 1002,4,3,4, is a multiply instruction - the rightmost two digits of the first value, 02, indicate opcode 2, multiplication. Then, going right to left, the parameter modes are 0 (hundreds digit), 1 (thousands digit), and 0 (ten-thousands digit, not present and therefore zero):

ABCDE
 1002

DE - two-digit opcode,      02 == opcode 2
 C - mode of 1st parameter,  0 == position mode
 B - mode of 2nd parameter,  1 == immediate mode
 A - mode of 3rd parameter,  0 == position mode,
                                  omitted due to being a leading zero

This instruction multiplies its first two parameters. The first parameter, 4 in position mode, works like it did before - its value is the value stored at address 4 (33). The second parameter, 3 in immediate mode, simply has value 3. The result of this operation, 33 * 3 = 99, is written according to the third parameter, 4 in position mode, which also works like it did before - 99 is written to address 4.

Parameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode.

Finally, some notes:

    It is important to remember that the instruction pointer should increase by the number of values in the instruction after the instruction finishes. Because of the new instructions, this amount is no longer always 4.
    Integers can be negative: 1101,100,-1,4,0 is a valid program (find 100 + -1, store the result in position 4).

The TEST diagnostic program will start by requesting from the user the ID of the system to test by running an input instruction - provide it 1, the ID for the ship's air conditioner unit.

It will then perform a series of diagnostic tests confirming that various parts of the Intcode computer, like parameter modes, function correctly. For each test, it will run an output instruction indicating how far the result of the test was from the expected value, where 0 means the test was successful. Non-zero outputs mean that a function is not working correctly; check the instructions that were run before the output instruction to see which one failed.

Finally, the program will output a diagnostic code and immediately halt. This final output isn't an error; an output followed immediately by a halt means the program finished. If all outputs were zero except the diagnostic code, the diagnostic program ran successfully.

After providing 1 to the only input instruction and passing all the tests, what diagnostic code does the program produce?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Day 6: Universal Orbit Map ---

You've landed at the Universal Orbit Map facility on Mercury. Because navigation in space often involves transferring between orbits, the orbit maps here are useful for finding efficient routes between, for example, you and Santa. You download a map of the local orbits (your puzzle input).

Except for the universal Center of Mass (COM), every object in space is in orbit around exactly one other object. An orbit looks roughly like this:

                  \
                   \
                    |
                    |
AAA--> o            o <--BBB
                    |
                    |
                   /
                  /

In this diagram, the object BBB is in orbit around AAA. The path that BBB takes around AAA (drawn with lines) is only partly shown. In the map data, this orbital relationship is written AAA)BBB, which means "BBB is in orbit around AAA".

Before you use your map data to plot a course, you need to make sure it wasn't corrupted during the download. To verify maps, the Universal Orbit Map facility uses orbit count checksums - the total number of direct orbits (like the one shown above) and indirect orbits.

Whenever A orbits B and B orbits C, then A indirectly orbits C. This chain can be any number of objects long: if A orbits B, B orbits C, and C orbits D, then A indirectly orbits D.

For example, suppose you have the following map:

COM)B
B)C
C)D
D)E
E)F
B)G
G)H
D)I
E)J
J)K
K)L

Visually, the above map of orbits looks like this:

        G - H       J - K - L
       /           /
COM - B - C - D - E - F
               \
                I

In this visual representation, when two objects are connected by a line, the one on the right directly orbits the one on the left.

Here, we can count the total number of orbits as follows:

    D directly orbits C and indirectly orbits B and COM, a total of 3 orbits.
    L directly orbits K and indirectly orbits J, E, D, C, B, and COM, a total of 7 orbits.
    COM orbits nothing.

The total number of direct and indirect orbits in this example is 42.

What is the total number of direct and indirect orbits in your map data?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Day 7: Amplification Circuit ---

Based on the navigational maps, you're going to need to send more power to your ship's thrusters to reach Santa in time. To do this, you'll need to configure a series of amplifiers already installed on the ship.

There are five amplifiers connected in series; each one receives an input signal and produces an output signal. They are connected such that the first amplifier's output leads to the second amplifier's input, the second amplifier's output leads to the third amplifier's input, and so on. The first amplifier's input value is 0, and the last amplifier's output leads to your ship's thrusters.

    O-------O  O-------O  O-------O  O-------O  O-------O
0 ->| Amp A |->| Amp B |->| Amp C |->| Amp D |->| Amp E |-> (to thrusters)
    O-------O  O-------O  O-------O  O-------O  O-------O

The Elves have sent you some Amplifier Controller Software (your puzzle input), a program that should run on your existing Intcode computer. Each amplifier will need to run a copy of the program.

When a copy of the program starts running on an amplifier, it will first use an input instruction to ask the amplifier for its current phase setting (an integer from 0 to 4). Each phase setting is used exactly once, but the Elves can't remember which amplifier needs which phase setting.

The program will then call another input instruction to get the amplifier's input signal, compute the correct output signal, and supply it back to the amplifier with an output instruction. (If the amplifier has not yet received an input signal, it waits until one arrives.)

Your job is to find the largest output signal that can be sent to the thrusters by trying every possible combination of phase settings on the amplifiers. Make sure that memory is not shared or reused between copies of the program.

For example, suppose you want to try the phase setting sequence 3,1,2,4,0, which would mean setting amplifier A to phase setting 3, amplifier B to setting 1, C to 2, D to 4, and E to 0. Then, you could determine the output signal that gets sent from amplifier E to the thrusters with the following steps:

    Start the copy of the amplifier controller software that will run on amplifier A. At its first input instruction, provide it the amplifier's phase setting, 3. At its second input instruction, provide it the input signal, 0. After some calculations, it will use an output instruction to indicate the amplifier's output signal.
    Start the software for amplifier B. Provide it the phase setting (1) and then whatever output signal was produced from amplifier A. It will then produce a new output signal destined for amplifier C.
    Start the software for amplifier C, provide the phase setting (2) and the value from amplifier B, then collect its output signal.
    Run amplifier D's software, provide the phase setting (4) and input value, and collect its output signal.
    Run amplifier E's software, provide the phase setting (0) and input value, and collect its output signal.

The final output signal from amplifier E would be sent to the thrusters. However, this phase setting sequence may not have been the best one; another sequence might have sent a higher signal to the thrusters.

Here are some example programs:

    Max thruster signal 43210 (from phase setting sequence 4,3,2,1,0):

    3,15,3,16,1002,16,10,16,1,16,15,15,4,15,99,0,0

    Max thruster signal 54321 (from phase setting sequence 0,1,2,3,4):

    3,23,3,24,1002,24,10,24,1002,23,-1,23,
    101,5,23,23,1,24,23,23,4,23,99,0,0

    Max thruster signal 65210 (from phase setting sequence 1,0,4,3,2):

    3,31,3,32,1002,32,10,32,1001,31,-2,31,1007,31,0,33,
    1002,33,7,33,1,33,31,31,1,32,31,31,4,31,99,0,0,0

Try every combination of phase settings on the amplifiers. What is the highest signal that can be sent to the thrusters?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Day 8: Space Image Format ---

The Elves' spirits are lifted when they realize you have an opportunity to reboot one of their Mars rovers, and so they are curious if you would spend a brief sojourn on Mars. You land your ship near the rover.

When you reach the rover, you discover that it's already in the process of rebooting! It's just waiting for someone to enter a BIOS password. The Elf responsible for the rover takes a picture of the password (your puzzle input) and sends it to you via the Digital Sending Network.

Unfortunately, images sent via the Digital Sending Network aren't encoded with any normal encoding; instead, they're encoded in a special Space Image Format. None of the Elves seem to remember why this is the case. They send you the instructions to decode it.

Images are sent as a series of digits that each represent the color of a single pixel. The digits fill each row of the image left-to-right, then move downward to the next row, filling rows top-to-bottom until every pixel of the image is filled.

Each image actually consists of a series of identically-sized layers that are filled in this way. So, the first digit corresponds to the top-left pixel of the first layer, the second digit corresponds to the pixel to the right of that on the same layer, and so on until the last digit, which corresponds to the bottom-right pixel of the last layer.

For example, given an image 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall, the image data 123456789012 corresponds to the following image layers:

Layer 1: 123
         456

Layer 2: 789
         012

The image you received is 25 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.

To make sure the image wasn't corrupted during transmission, the Elves would like you to find the layer that contains the fewest 0 digits. On that layer, what is the number of 1 digits multiplied by the number of 2 digits?
-----------------------------------------------------------
